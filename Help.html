                <h1>Now, hopefully you see all of this and feel that you want to help. Well, there many ways to help us. You can support us by sending a donation
                   which helps funds all our extensive projects like building wind farms and aid to climate crisis victims. But you can take it even a
                    step further by joining our team. Even with all the money in the world, these projects won't get done by themselves and being a 
                  C.O.A.L volunteer is something special to us and the earth. But you know what, you don't even have to necessarily join our team. You can still
                  do things like picking up trash when you see it, or planting trees as well as conserving energy. 
                  Or even as simple as just spreading awareness about us on social media is beneficial.
                  There no insigificant way to help us overcome climate change.  </h1>
