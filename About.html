                <h1> There may be some that might not know what climate change is. Climate Change is sort of a long term event where shifts in 
                  tempurature and weather patterns occur overtime. A huge part of this is due to human activity like burning fossil fuels to power our
                  modern day civilization. This has led to higher temperatures and natural disasters throughout the years.
                   Now contrary to popular belief, Climate Change is a at least somewhat a natural process and some of these affects are normal. However, 
                 constant human activity has really accelerated these climate shifts to lengths that were thought not possible. Many Scientists agree that 
                human activity is responsible for practically all global heating that has taken place for the past 200 years. If current trends continue,
              we could be moving the earth towards the point of no return into an unsustainable environment for any living thing. There is no time like
            the present to start implenting various practices in order to fight back against global climate change and we need as many people as 
          possible to help with our cause either directly or indirectly. </h1>
